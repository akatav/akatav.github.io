We will generate a graphic in the following chunk.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

Person1 <- c(1,-1,0.75,-2,2,2.5,3,0,1,1.5,4,2)
Person2 <- c(1,0.5,-1,-2,1.5,2.4,1.8,4,4,4.2,4, 4.5)
df <- data.frame(cbind(Person1, Person2))

colors= c(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2)
person_ggplot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Person1, y = Person2, colour=factor(colors))) + geom_point()

person_ggplot <- person_ggplot + geom_point(alpha = 1/3)  # alpha b/c of overplotting
person_ggplot <- person_ggplot + coord_fixed()
```

In-line code is great for things like summary statistics.  The mean miles per gallon for the `mtcars` data set is `r mean(mtcars$mpg)`.

In-line code is not good for graphics, as you know.  

Instead, use a chunk.  This will also allow you to control how the graphic is
rendered in your final document.

```{r show_figure, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}

person_ggplot

```
