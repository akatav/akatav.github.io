### ABIDE dataset

The ABIDE dataset is one of the few excellent datasets for research in autism. It consists of resting state fMRI and structural MRI data from 539 individuals having Autism Spectrum disorder (which includes asperger's syndrome, ADHD) and 537 typical control individuals (who do not have the above condition(s)) alongwith detailed phenotypic information. The data is in the form of .nii (nifti) file format. This can be downloaded from Amazon s3 buckets such as:[Pitt_0050003](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fcp-indi/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/Outputs/cpac/nofilt_noglobal/func_preproc/Pitt_0050003_func_preproc.nii.gz){:target="_blank"}

ABIDE initiative collected data from 16 different sites such as Caltech, CMU, Univ. of Pittsburgh and so on. More information on this can be found [here](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html){:target:"_blank"}. In the example given above, "Pitt" represents the SITE_ID and the subject id (0050003) represents the ID of the individual whose NIFT brain images we would like to download. 

The dataset also contains a csv file that list all phenotypic attributes of each individual scanned, such as age, gender, site where individual was scanned, DX_GROUP (indicates whether individual has autism or not) and various other quantitative variables measuring the social, communication scores of the individual. This file can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fcp-indi/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/Phenotypic_V1_0b_preprocessed1.csv){:target:"_blank"}. A full description of the various phenotypic attributes can be found [here](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
