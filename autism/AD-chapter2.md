### Functional MRI (fMRI) and Structural MRI

Structural MRI (or simply MRI) is the technique traditionally used to visualize and understand the anatomical structures of a brain by measuring the density of water molecules. This is, however, not measured over a period of time. fMRI, on the other hand, scans the brain over a period of time, rapidly imaging the brain several thousand times both in resting and active state. fMRI uses the blood oxygentation level dependant (BOLD signal) instead of the density of the water molecules in the brain. fMRI allows the care provider to observe the brain while in functioning state such as viewing images, reading and so on. Traditional MRI does not allow such task based observations  of brain  function.
