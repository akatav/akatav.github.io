### Image registration

<li>Dataset consisted of a stack of 2d images obtained from live imaging (in-vivo) of mouse hippocampus. Each image is obtained at successive depths along the axial plane. </li>
<li>The mouse is sedated but there is movement from respiration,heartbeat and other body movements such as head motion. </li>
<li>This movement affects the images as the resulting images can be distorted and blurred. </li>
<li>It is therefore neceessary to do movement or motion correction of these images to remove the motion artifacts caused by the afore-mentioned body movements.</li>
<li>There are various packages and libraries to remove such motion artifacts from images, such as ImageJ plugins like StackReg,TurboReg,MultiStackReg.There are others like ptvReg in Matlab.</li>
<li>We will look at some of these algorithms and implementations in this blog.</li>
