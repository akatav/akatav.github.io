# Further questions and concluding remarks

> What are the assumptions of LDA/Fisher's ? Do they assume no correlation between the features ? How do these   
assumptions affect the classification ?

> If $$n>K$$ or vice versa, how does it affect the covariance matrices ?

> What is the effect of the covariance matrices being symmetric, positive semi definite ?

> Computing $$S_w^{-1}$$ can be expensive - Comments?

> Does data need to be standardized and scaled prior to FDA? 

> How is FDA different from LDA ? How is it related to Bayes ?

> Does FDA hold only when the underlying covariance matrices are similar ?

> How are ANOVA, MANOVA related to FDA ?

> How is CCA related to FDA ?

> How multiclass LDA works ? 

> How is SVD better than eigen decomposition ?

> What to do when $$p>>>n$$ ?

> Implementations of advanced Fisher's like SparseLDA, penalizedLDA
